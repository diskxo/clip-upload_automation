# clip-upload_automation
 Python script to upload recorded clips to youtube (private) to free up disk space.

# How to use  
<br>
insert the client_secret of https://console.developers.google.com/ in the same directory as the script, and the related videos you want to upload (I set this folder as the default where OBS saves .mp4 videos).
